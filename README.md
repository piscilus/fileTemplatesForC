# File templates for C

This repository provides file templates for source code written in C.

The templates are intended for the modular programming of software. A typical 
C module consists of a header file (\*.h) and a source file (\*.c). Templates 
for both file types are provided.

The files have a uniform structure for placing the individual parts of the 
code.

- compliant to the basic source character set
- EOL character is 'LF'
- limited to 80 characters per line (without EOL)
- prepared for doxygen
- MIT license
